		<p class="bio">My name is Matt Verdillo and I have worked in the IT consulting/staffing industry for close to 5 years. I come from the business side but have formed great relationships with some Senior Software Engineers in Nashville and have developed a passion for this work. I'm more than excited to learn, develop, and create.
